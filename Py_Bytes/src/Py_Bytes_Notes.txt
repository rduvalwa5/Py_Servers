4.8.1. Bytes
Bytes objects are immutable sequences of single bytes. Since many major binary protocols are based on the ASCII text encoding,
bytes objects offer several methods that are only valid when working with ASCII compatible data and are closely related to 
string objects in a variety of other ways.

Bytes leterals:

syntax for bytes literals is for string literals
	- except that a b prefix is added:

	Single quotes: b'still allows embedded "double" quotes'
	Double quotes: b"still allows embedded 'single' quotes".
	Triple quoted: b'''3 single quotes''', b"""3 double quotes"""

Only ASCII characters are permitted in bytes literals (regardless of the declared source code encoding)
	- binary values over 127 must be entered into bytes literals using the appropriate escape sequence
	- string literals and bytes literals may also use a r prefix to disable processing of escape sequences
	- bytes literals and representations are based on ASCII text
	    bytes objects actually behave like immutable sequences of integers
	    with each value in the sequence restricted such that 0 <= x < 256 

Bytes objects can be created in a number of other ways:
	- A zero-filled bytes object of a specified length: bytes(10)
	- From an iterable of integers: bytes(range(20))
	- Copying existing binary data via the buffer protocol: bytes(obj)
