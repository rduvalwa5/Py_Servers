*** Zenmap ******************************* 
Nmap is a free and open source utility for network exploration and security auditing. Zenmap is a multi-platform graphical frontend 
and results viewer for Nmap. Ncat is a general-purpose network sending and receiving utility, a reimplementation of Netcat. 
Ndiff is a an Nmap scan comparison utility. Nping is a tool for packet generation and sending.

This package contains Nmap, Zenmap, Ncat, Ndiff, and Nping. It is intended to work on Intel Macs running Mac OS X 10.8 or later.

Installation of all packages is optional. Unselect Zenmap to get just the command-line tool. 
Unselect Nmap if you prefer to use a copy of Nmap that is already installed. Zenmap will not work without Nmap.

The nmap, ncat, ndiff, and nping command-line binaries will be installed in /usr/local/bin, and additional support files 
will be installed in /usr/local/share. The Zenmap application bundle will be installed in /Applications/Zenmap.app.

5.8. Verifying Which Ports Are Listening

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/3/html/Security_Guide/s1-server-ports.html

After configuring network services, it is important to pay attention to which ports are actually listening on the system's network 
interfaces. Any open ports can be evidence of an intrusion.

There are two basic approaches for listing the ports that are listening on the network. The less reliable approach is 
to query the network stack by typing commands such as netstat -an or lsof -i. This method is less reliable since 
these programs do not connect to the machine from the network, but rather check to see what is running on the system. 
For this reason, these applications are frequent targets for replacement by attackers. In this way, crackers attempt 
to cover their tracks if they open unauthorized network ports.

A more reliable way to check which ports are listening on the network is to use a port scanner such as nmap.

The following command issued from the console determines which ports are listening for TCP connections from the network:
	nmap -sT -O localhost
	The output of this command looks like the following:

	Starting nmap V. 3.00 ( www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
	Interesting ports on localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1):
	(The 1596 ports scanned but not shown below are in state: closed)
	Port       State       Service
	22/tcp     open        ssh
	111/tcp    open        sunrpc
	515/tcp    open        printer
	834/tcp    open        unknown
	6000/tcp   open        X11
	Remote OS guesses: Linux Kernel 2.4.0 or Gentoo 1.2 Linux 2.4.19 rc1-rc7)

	Nmap run completed -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5 seconds

This output shows the system is running portmap due to the presence of the sunrpc service. However, there is also a mystery 
service on port 834. 

To check if the port is associated with the official list of known services, type:
	cat /etc/services | grep 834

This command returns no output. This indicates that while the port is in the reserved range (meaning 0 through 1023) 
and requires root access to open, it is not associated with a known service.

Next, check for information about the port using netstat or lsof. To check for port 834 using netstat, use the following command:
	netstat -anp | grep 834

The command returns the following output:

	tcp   0    0 0.0.0.0:834    0.0.0.0:*   LISTEN   653/ypbind

The presence of the open port in netstat is reassuring because a cracker opening a port surreptitiously on a 
hacked system would likely not allow it to be revealed through this command. Also, the [p] option reveals the 
process id (PID) of the service which opened the port. In this case the open port belongs to ypbind (NIS), which 
is an RPC service handled in conjunction with the portmap service.

The lsof command reveals similar information since it is also capable of linking open ports to services:
	lsof -i | grep 834

Below is the relevant portion of the output for this command:

	ypbind      653        0    7u  IPv4       1319                 TCP *:834 (LISTEN)
	ypbind      655        0    7u  IPv4       1319                 TCP *:834 (LISTEN)
	ypbind      656        0    7u  IPv4       1319                 TCP *:834 (LISTEN)
	ypbind      657        0    7u  IPv4       1319                 TCP *:834 (LISTEN)

These tools reveal a great deal about the status of the services running on a machine. These tools are flexible 
and can provide a wealth of information about network services and configuration. Consulting the man pages for lsof, 
netstat, nmap, and services is therefore highly recommended.


B)  Looking for a port scanner such as nmap or netcat, both of which are available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.
	For example, check for telnet on a known ip:

  	nmap -A 192.168.0.5/32 -p 23
	For example, look for open ports from 20 to 30 on host.example.com:
	nc -z host.example.com 20-30
